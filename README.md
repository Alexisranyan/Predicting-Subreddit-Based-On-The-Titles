The two subreddits I chose for this project are:
Relationships subreddit:<br>
The relationships subreddit is a platform for people to post their relationship issues and ask people for advice.
JUSTNOMIL subreddit: <br>
Justnomil is a similar subreddit but specifically for issues regarding peopleâ€™s difficult mother in laws.

##### model 1 (pipeline model using TfidfVectorizer with MultinomialNB):
Accuracy: 0.888
Specificity: 0.928
Sensitivity: 0.848
AUC: 0.96

##### model 2 (pipeline model using CountVectorizer with Logistic Regression):
I used gridsearch to find out the best logistic regression is with Ridge
The best model
Accuracy: 0.904
